# Lacak.io Backend Test

This project aim is to record, and keep a huge collection of cities across Canada and USA. I have noticed from the original data, several cities in the state of Minnesota were also missing. I improved it by adding a approve based contributing system. Users can contribute to create a missing geo city, complete with all of the information, but the data needs to be manually validated by Community Moderator, where a moderator can approve contributions data.

## API Reference
